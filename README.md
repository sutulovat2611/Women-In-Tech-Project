# Women-In-Tech-Project
Project descriptionThe Empowering Women project is aimed to support communication between older women in ASEAN countries, help them discover new interests and support existing ones by providing recommendations based on their culture, background and other relevant information. The software is expected to provide multiple features in aid of achieving the goal. These features include the ability to post and interact with other users who share mutual interests, a recommendation system that allows users to browse content based on their interests and further educate themselves in various fields they find interesting. Lastly the application will have an administrator dashboard to collect the data on the users that will be shown to admins and researchers. This is to track the usual interest of older women and whether the goal of the application is achieved.

There were three teams of 5-6 people working on the following project. Each of them was responsible for one of the submodules: forum, chatbot and recommender.
My team and I were responsible for the Forum submodule, Login functionality and the Main Menu. My role in this project was System Architect (SA), whereas the main responsibilities were defining and deciding the right IT strategies that will best support the business goals. Moreover, another responsibility was to advise the team on the best tools, frameworks and other IT-elements, which would be the most applicable for the development of this software. Lastly, I was responsible for the User Interface of our submodule in the application. The main concerns about UI in this application were not only to make it follow design rules and principles, but also to ensure that it fits the target users, who may be unexperienced or even have certain level of visual and hearing impairments.
